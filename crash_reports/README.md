## EASY

Scenes with single dynamic agents at a time (ex. the AV is stopped but is rear ended) or
two dynamic agents proceeding straight only (no turns).

## MEDIUM

Scenes which have two dynamic agents at a time or single agents that are doing single 
maneuvers (driving straight, turning left or right) in spaces that are not supported in default CARLA maps (ex. parking 
lots). 

## HARD

Scenarios which have more than two agents simultaneously, compound manuevers that 
are made of single primitive manuevers such as lane switching (right 
straight left or vis-versa), or aggressive drivers.
