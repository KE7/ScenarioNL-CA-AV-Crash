## EASY

Scenes with single dynamic agents (ex. the AV is stopped but is rear ended) or
two agents proceeding straight only (no turns).

## MEDIUM

Scenes which have two dynamic agents or single agents that are doing single 
maneuvers in spaces that are not supported in default CARLA maps (ex. parking 
lots). 

## HARD

Scenarios which have more than two dynamic agents, compound manuevers that 
are made of single primitive manuevers such as lane switching (right 
straight left or vis-versa), or aggressive drivers.
